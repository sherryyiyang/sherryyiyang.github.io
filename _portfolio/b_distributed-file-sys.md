title: "Golong Distributed File System"
excerpt: " A lightweight, peer-to-peer distributed file system implemented in Go. This project demonstrates the core principles of distributed storage, including file replication, peer discovery, and secure data transfer.
Peer-to-Peer Architecture: Nodes communicate directly, eliminating the need for a central server. File Replication: Ensures data redundancy by replicating files across multiple peers. Secure Communication: Utilizes cryptographic techniques to secure data transmission between nodes. Modular Design: Components like storage, networking, and cryptography are modular, facilitating easy maintenance and extension. Command-Line Interface: Simple CLI for interacting with the file system.
