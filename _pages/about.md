I love build thoughtful, scalable web applications that make a difference. I’ve worked across the full stack, from real estate platforms to scientific tooling, and I’m always eager to dive deeper into the backend: distributed systems, API design, data infrastructure, and cloud architecture. 

I’m currently exploring areas like distributed systems, blockchain, and Web3 — technologies that push the boundaries of scalability, reliability, and innovation. I’m especially interested in how large-scale systems are designed, maintained, and optimized to serve millions of users. I’m eager to keep growing, contribute to impactful projects, and collaborate with others who care about building the future.

# 🔧 What I Do

I build full-stack web applications using technologies like React, Flask, Node.js, and PostgreSQL, with focus on clean architecture and maintainability. 

Beyond coding, I’m deeply involved in the full software lifecycle — writing unit and integration tests, setting up CI/CD pipelines, and ensuring smooth deployments. I’ve taken part in on-call rotations, handled production issues, and used tools like Datadog and AWS to monitor performance and ensure system reliability. From feature development to backend optimization and production support, I take ownership across the stack to deliver robust and user-centered software.
