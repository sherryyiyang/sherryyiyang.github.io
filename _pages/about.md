I love build thoughtful, scalable web applications that make a difference. I’ve worked across the full stack, from real estate platforms to scientific tooling, and I’m always eager to dive deeper into the backend: distributed systems, API design, data infrastructure, and cloud architecture. 

Lately, I’ve been exploring areas like deep learning, real-time systems, and even Web3 — anything that stretches the boundary between code and creativity. Whether it's shipping production-ready features or optimizing data pipelines for millions of records, I thrive on solving tough problems and learning what’s next. I’m excited about technologies that shape the future — from AI to decentralized platforms — and I’m always looking for opportunities to grow, collaborate, and build what matters.


# 🔧 What I Do

I build full-stack web applications using technologies like React, Flask, Node.js, and PostgreSQL, with focus on clean architecture and maintainability. 

Beyond coding, I’m deeply involved in the full software lifecycle — writing unit and integration tests, setting up CI/CD pipelines, and ensuring smooth deployments. I’ve taken part in on-call rotations, handled production issues, and used tools like Datadog and AWS to monitor performance and ensure system reliability. From feature development to backend optimization and production support, I take ownership across the stack to deliver robust and user-centered software.
